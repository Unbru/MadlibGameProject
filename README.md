# MadlibGameProject
I made a simple MadLibs game with formatting and text color.

An output should look like this:

I did a horrid thing.
I ruined this thing.
In other words the thing was grotesque.
Well, I'm a bit uneasy to tell you, but...
I was pounding a pound of cheese.
Yeah, yeah, I know it was a horrid thing to do.
But I had to do it, if I didnt, Patrick would have ate the whole pound.
